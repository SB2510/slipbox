# What is the differential quotient? 
The differential quotient is a different way of expressing the difference quotient [[20240926131218]].
It is useful, when deriving derivatives from the limit.
It looks like this $\frac{f(x+dx)-f(x)}{dx}$.

## Using with lim
It is useful for deriving rules for derivation. For example if you wanted to derive the rules for additive constanst 
you would define a function $f(x) = x + k$. Then you would try to calculate the limit
$\lim_{dx\to 0} \frac{f(x+dx)-f(x)}{dx}$.
This would yield $\lim_{dx\to 0} \frac{(x+dx+k)-(x+k)}{dx}$
When going a bit further you get 1. (because x-x and k-k fall away and then you just have $\frac{dx}{dx})$, which is 1. So f'(x) of f(x)=x+k is the same as g'(x) of g(x)=x.
All in all this means, that the additive constant just drops away.

Using this allows you to find all rules for derivating any function you'd like.
