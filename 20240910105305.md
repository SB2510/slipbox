# What are the Peano axioms? 
The Peano axioms are a set of axioms defining natural numbers $\N$ [[20240910105916]].
There are 5 axioms, which are as follows:
1. 0 is a natural number $\N$
2. Every natural number $\N$ has exactly one successor ($S(0) = 1$)
3. 0 is not the successor of a natural number $\N$
4. Different natural numbers have different successors (no two different natural numbers have the same successor)
5. Every property, which applies to 0 and every successor is applicable to all natural numbers.

The fifth axiom is especially important for induction (it's called the induction axiom) [[20240910102356]] [[20240910103615]].
