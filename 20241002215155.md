# What is a constant series? 
A constant series $a_n$ is a series [[20241002211453]] for which there are finite distinct elements.

For example $(a_n)_{n>=0}=(-1)^n$ would be a constant series, because there are finitely many distinc elements
$\{1,-1\}$. 1 and -1 would be cluster points for this series.
