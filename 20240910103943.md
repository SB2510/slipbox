# How does induction work?
Induction works by applying two distinct logical forms to a statement.

## First form using P(n) => P(n+1)
$P(0) \land (\forall n \in \N: P(n) \implies P(n+1)) \implies \forall n \in \N: P(n)$
Which means if a predicate P is true for 0 ($P(0)$) (or the inductions beginning(Induktionsanfang)) and $P(n) \implies P(n+1)$ which means 
the predicate P(n) (also called Induction Requirement) implies P(n+1) (Induction Reasoning), then P is true for all N ($\forall n \in \N: P(n)$).

## Second form using P(k)
Sometimes it's more helpful not to use the induction reasoning and instead use information about all previous P(k).
E.g. Assuming $P(0), P(1), … , P(n)$ is valid and getting $P(n+1)$ from it.
Logically it looks like this: 
$P(0) \land (\forall n \in \N: (\forall k ≤ n: P(k)) \implies P(n+1)) \implies \forall n \in \N: P(n)$
