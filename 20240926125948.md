# What is the rule of Descartes ? 
The rule of descartes is a rule regarding the rational zeroes of polynomials [[20240920124236]].
It says, that the number of sign changes for f(x) is the number of positive zeroes and the number of sign changes in f(-x) is the number of negative zeroes.

## Example
f(x) = 2x^2+5x-1
This has 1 sign change. so it has 1 positive 0.

Now we look at f(-x).

f(-x)=-2x^2-5x+1
Also has 1 sign change so it has 1 negative zero.
