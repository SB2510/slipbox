# How to convert a number to excess notation?
To convert a number x to the excess notation [[20241010151125]] in binary [[20241007151817]] of an excess e you need to add x and e together.

## Example
If you wanted to represent the number 69 with a 8 bit excess of 127, then you would add the two together
resulting in $196_{10}$. Then you would convert it to binary yielding a result of 128 + 64 + 2 = $11000020_2$.
This would be the number in excess notation.

If you wanted to represent the number $-69_{10}$ in excess notation you would again add -69 and 127,
which would yield $58_{10}$. You would then convert this number into binary yielding $00110000_2$.
This would be -69 in excess notation.
