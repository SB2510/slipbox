# How are absolute convergence and the majorant criterion related?
The majorant criterium [[20241021152116]] and aboslute convergence [[20241030123628]] are related in that the majorant constrains the 
absolutely convergent series [[20241021151020]]. This implies, that the conditionally convergent series is also convergent.
