# What is the pigeonhole principle? 
## Simple 
The pigeonhole principle is a proof [[20240910102356]] technique for combinatorics problems [[20241104090341]] that relies on the following theorem:

If n pigeons are assigned to m holes, and $m<n$, then at least one hole contains more than 2 pigeons.

## Extended
If n pigeons are assigned to m pigeonholes, then one of the pigeonholes must contain at least $\lfloor (n-1)/m \rfloor+1$ pigeons.k
