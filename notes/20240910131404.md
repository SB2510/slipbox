# How to find the greatest common divisor?
When searching for the largest common denominator for two numbers a and b you to the following

$a = b*q_0 + r_0, 0 < r_0 < b$
$b = r_0*q_1 + r_1, 0 < r_1 < r_0$
 $r_0 = r_1*q_2 + r_2, 0 < r_2 < r_1$
  $\vdots$
   $r_{k-1} = r_k*q_{k+1} + 0$
   Where the last r-value is the greatest common divisor
