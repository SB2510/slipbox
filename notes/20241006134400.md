# How to prove a limit of a sequence? 
To prove [[20240910102356]] a limit $a$ [[20241002212517]] of a series $a_n$ [[20241002211453]] you have to define an index $N(\epsilon)$ for each
possible value of $\epsilon>0$, so that all elements after the index N are within the epsilon-environment [[20241002212206]]
of the limit ($|a_n-a|<\epsilon$). If such a function $N(\epsilon)$ can be defined for $a$, that the series $a_n$ converges to $a$.
