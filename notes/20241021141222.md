# How to use Hamming-Codes to check and fix encoded data?
To check and fix data, that was encoded using Hamming Code [[20241016123700]]  follow these steps:
1. Set the correction indicator to 0.
2. Check if parity bit[[20241016123204]] 1 ($2^0$ is correct). If it is, that's good. If it isn't, add the value of the parity bit to the correction indicator (in this case 1).
3. Check the next indicator and do the same.

# Example.
Encoding the 5 bits 1001 ($9_{10}$) with hamming code would need 3 parity bits ([[20241006152033]]), so the message is 7 bits long in total.
| c1 | c2 | c3 | c4 | c5 | c6 | c7 | 
| p1 | p2 | d1 | p3 | d2 | d3 | d4 |
| p1 | p2 | 1   | p3 |  0  |  0  |  1  | 

1. Calculate the first parity bit (XOR c3 c5 and c7) which yields 0. 
2. Calculate the second parity bit (XOR c3, c6 and c7) which yields 0.
3. Calculate the third parity bit (XOR c5, c6, c7) which yields 1.
Our message now is 0011001.

Let's say during transmission c6 got flipped so we have 0011011.
Now let's decode. 
1. Set the correcting indicator to 0
2. Check parity bit 1 (p1) $1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1$= 0. This is still true.
3. Check parity bit 2 (p2) $1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1$=1. This is not true, so we add $2^1$ (2) to the correction indicator
4. Check parity bit 3 (p3) $0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1$=0. This is also not correct with our parity bit, so we add $2^2$ (4) to the correction indicator.
5. Now our correction indicator is showing 6, which is in fact the bit, that got flipped. So we correct it and get our actual message back.
