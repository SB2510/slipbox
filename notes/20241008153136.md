# Whats the one's complement of a number? 
The ones complement of a number is a way of representing a negative number in base [[20241007151205]] 2 (or binary [[20241007151817]]) by inverting all of the bits of its positive counterpart.

So for example the unsigned 3 bit integer $7_{10}$ which is $111_2$ in binary would become -0 as a ones compement.
| Bits | Unsigned Value | One's complement Value |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| 000  |  0             | +0                     |
| 001  |  1             | +1                     |
| 010  |  2             | +2                     |
| 011  |  3             | +3                     |
| 100  |  4             | -3                     |
| 101  |  5             | -2                     |
| 110  |  6             | -1                     |
| 111  |  7             | -0                     |

This is especially useful when subtracting in binary.
