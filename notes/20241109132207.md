# What problems are ordering or unique elements? 
Ordering of unique elements refers to ordering problems[[20241104095747]], that don't allow for repetition. 
"Variation without repetition".

So after an element is used once it can't be used again and therefore the number of possible elements for the
rest of the places is decreased. 

e.g. How many different 3 letter words are there with an alphabet of 26 letters?

These problems are always solved like this:
$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.

The answer for the example above is $\frac{26!}{23!}=15600$.
