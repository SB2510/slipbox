# How to apply binary operations to numbers as floats?
To apply any binary operation (an operation, that needs 2 operands) to numbers as floats [[20241010165723]] do the following things:
1. Normalize the number
2. Bring the numbers to the same exponent (by shifting the larger number number to the right) (the new bits fill the guard, round and sticky bit [[20241014194612]])
3. Apply your operation to the mantissas of the numbers
4. Apply the rules for the GRS bits to the result [[20241014195117]].
