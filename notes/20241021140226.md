# How do Hamming-Codes work? 
Data encoded with [[20241016123700]] has parity bits [[20241016123204]] at every $2^n$-th place (1,2,4,8,16).
All parity bits get their value from XOR-ing the bits who's index it is "on" in (e.g. $2^2$ would contribute to 3 (11), 6(110) and 7(111)).
This bits then get stored with the other bits and when the data is decoded checks (and even repairs) can be run to detect (and fix) errors.
