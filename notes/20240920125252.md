# What is the Factor theorem? 

The factor theorem is a theorem regarding polynomial [[20240920124236]] functions.
It states that if $x-c$ is a factor of a polynomial $P(x)$ (dividing it with a remainder of 0 [[20240920123948]]) then $P(c)$ is a zero of the polynomial.
This also means, that if all zeroes of a polynomial ($z_0...z_n$) are know the polynomial can be written as a multiplication:
$(x-z_0)*(x-z_1)*...*(x-z_n)$.
This representation of the polynomial is called its factored form.
