# What are the problems when using the one's complement to subtract? 
The problem when using the one's complement of a number for subtracting binary numbers [[20241008160800]] comes from the existence of two zeroes in the representation. This leads to 
results of subtractions not being what they should be (so you have to do do some error correction when you are done)
