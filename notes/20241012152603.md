# What is the implicit first bit? 
The implicit first bit refers to the fact, that in floating point number representations [[20241010165723]] the first bit of the mantissa [[20241010165917]] can be left out,
because it is only 0 if the denorm bit is true (so it's always 1 unless denorm is on in which case it is 0).
