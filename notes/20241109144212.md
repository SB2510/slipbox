# What theorems are there for the ggT? 
- If you run the euclidean algorithm [[20241010161911]] it has to stop at some point because $b>r_0>r_1>r_2>...>=0$. The last remainder is called the greatest common denominator
- If d is the greatest common denominator of the non-zero numbers a and b, there are numbers e and f, so that $ea + fb = d$. These can easily be calculated using the euclidean algorithm [[20241010161911]]
