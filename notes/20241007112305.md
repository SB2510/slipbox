# When does an algorithm have polynomial time? 
An algorithm has polynomial time, when the code can be reformed to nested loops. O(n) [[20241007114148]] $O(n)=n^x$ takes the form of a polynomial function [[20240920124236]]
(but only with the highest exponent)

e.g.
```c
int function(int n) {
	int i = 0;
    while(i < n^2) {
    
    }
}
```
would be the simplest O(n^2) loop.
