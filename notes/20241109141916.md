# What problems can be solved with the pigeonhole principle?
The following are problems, that can be solved using the pigeonhole principle[[20241109141627]]:

## Problem 1
If 5 numbers from the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} are chosen, then at least 2 of them add up to 9.
This can be solved by constructing sets of 2 numbers, that add up to 9
$\{1,8\}, \{2,7\},\{3,6\},\{4,5\}$. These sets cover all numbers from 1 to 8. There are 4 sets, but we choose 5 numbers,
so the pigeonhole principle tells us, that two numbers have to belong to the same set.

## Problem 2
If 30 people are chosen at random at least 5 of them were born on the same weekday.

30 pigeons are assigned to 7 pigeonholes. So one hole must contain $\lfloor 29/7 \rfloor +1 = 5$ must be assigned to the same hole.
This uses the extended pigeonhole principle
