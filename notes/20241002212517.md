# What is the limit of a sequence? 
A number x is limit of a sequence [[20241002211453]] $(a_n)_{n>=0}$ if for all epsilon environments[[20241002212206]] of a, almost all elements of $a_n$ are in the epsilon environment.
$\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N(\epsilon) \in \N \forall n>N(\epsilon): |a_n-x| < \epsilon$

$a$ is the limit of a sequence, if the following is true: 
If you define a distance $\epsilon > 0$ there is an index N, so that after N all
 elements of the sequence have a distance from a, which is smaller, than $\epsilon$.
