# What are the rules for optimal rounding with the guard, round and sticky bit?
The rules for optimal rounding of floating point numbers [[20241010165723]] using the guard, round and sticky [[20241014194612]] bit are described in the following table:

| G | R | S | Mantissa                         |
|---|---|---|----------------------------------|
| 0 | x | x | Unchanged (round down)           |
| 1 | 1 | x |  Result += 1 (round up)          |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | if lsb is 0 unchanged, else  +=1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | Result += 1 (round up)           |
