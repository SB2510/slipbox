# What is transfinite induction? 
Transfinite induction is a proof technique, that is an abstraction of complete induction, focussing more on relations [[20241030120213]], specifically partial orders [[20241030121034]].
It works by proving the following for a relation $R: R \subset A\times A$ on a set $A$:
$a\in A \land \forall b\in A: bRa \land P(b) \implies P(a)$
