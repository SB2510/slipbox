# When is a function bijective?
A function is called bijective, if it is surjective [[20240929162216]] as well as [[20240929161741]].
If a function is bijective, that also implies, that the function has an inverse [[20240929163004]], 
because each element in the co-domain can be mapped to an element in the domain, because of injectivity and surjectivity.
