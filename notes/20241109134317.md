# What problems are permutations of a multiset? 
Permutations of a multiset is an ordering problem [[20241104095747]] similar to permutations of a set,
but the element $a_n$ appears $k_n$ times.

e.g. In how many different combinations can you drink 2 Long Island Iced Teas, 4 Shots and 2 Jacky Cola?

These problems are solved with $\frac{(k_1+k_2+k_3+...+k_n)!}{k_1! k_2! â€¦ k_n!}$.

The solution to the above problem is 
$\frac{(2+4+2)}{2!4!2!}=\frac{8!}{2!2!4!}=420$
