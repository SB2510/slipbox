# What kinds of encodings are there? 
There are the following kinds of encodings [[20241016122310]]:
- BlockCodes
Is a fixed lenght code
    - Linear Codes
      Sum of valid codes is also a valid code
        - Cyclical Codes
          Shifted valid codes are also valid codes
    -  Non-Linear Codes
        Codes of length n contain m information bits and (n-m) parity bits
- Codes with variable length
  Codes that have variable length
