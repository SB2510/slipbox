# What are the different ways to round for floating point numbers? 
Rounding floating point numbers to the next numbers in their representation [[20241010165723]] is pretty simple
You calculate the boundary value of $\hat{x}$ which is $\frac{x_{n}+x_{n+1}}{2}$ if the number is larger round it to $x_{n+1}$, if it is smaller round it to $x_n$.
Now you have two possibilities if the value you want to round $x=\hat{x}$:
1. Round away from zero (which means rounding up/down, depending on the sign of the number)
2. Round to even (which means to round to the next number with 0 as the last bit)
