# When does an algorithm have logarithmic time? 
When a running variable i is repeatedly divided by a constand divisor. O(n) [[20241007114148]] $O(n)=log(n)$ or $O(n)=n*log(n)$ takes the form of a logarithmic function [[20241007115904]]

e.g. 
```c
void function(int n) {
	int i = n;
    while (i > 1){
    	i = i/2
    }
}
```
This would have a time of $O(n)=\log_2(n)$ or $O(n)=\log(n)$
