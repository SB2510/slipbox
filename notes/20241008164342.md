# Calculate the binary number -6 from 6 using the two's complement
1. Convert 6 to binary[[20241007151817]] having the first bit as the sign. 6 in binary is 110, but with a signed bit it's 0110
2. Flip all bits, so 0110 becomes 1001.
3. Add 1 to 1001, so it becomes 1010.

Now you have the two's complement  [[20241008163228]] of 6 (-6)
In order to verify this result add all place values except the sign value together and subtract the sign value.
