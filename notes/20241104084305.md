# When does a power series converge? What is a convergence radius? 
A power series [[20241104083948]] converges[[20241002213119]] if there is a number $R$ ($0<=R<=\infty$) so that $\forall x \in \mathbb{C} |x-x_0| < R$.

This number $R$ is called the convergence-radius. Everything smaller than $R$ is absolutely convergent and everything larger is divergent.
There are however the edgecases of $|x-x_0| = R$ which have to be treated seperately.
$R$ can be calculated like this (1 divided by the lim sup of the root criterion?):
$R= \frac{1}{\overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}}$
