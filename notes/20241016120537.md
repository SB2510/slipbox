# What rules are there for working with remainder systems? 
Addition and subtraction work without any restrictions for remainder systems [[20241016120254]]. (Addition working also implies that subtraction works without problems)
$\overline{a}+\overline{b} = \overline{a+b}$
$\overline{a} * \overline{b} = \overline{a*b}$

Division works if the divisor and the module are coprime [[20241010161419]] ($ggT(divisor, module)=1$).
$\frac{\overline{a}}{\overline{b}}=\overline{\frac{a}{b}}$
