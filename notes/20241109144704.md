# What theorems are there for congruencies/remainder systems? 

- For every positive natural number [[20240910105916]] m there are exactly m remainder systems [[20241016120254]].
- A remainder system has a multiplicative inverse [[20241016120945]] if and only if ggT(a,m) is 1
- Let $m=p_1^{e_1}...p_r^{e_r}$ be the prime factorization of m, then $\varphi(m)=m(1-\frac{1}{p_1})...(1-\frac{1}{p_r})$ ($\varphi(m)$ is eulers function [[20241109145707]])
- For two coprime [[20241010161419]] numbers a,m $a^{\varphi(m)}\equiv 1 \mod m$ is true
