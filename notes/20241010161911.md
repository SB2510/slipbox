# What is the euclidian algorithm?
The euclidian algorithm is an algorithm, that describes the steps needed for finding the largest common denominator [[20241010161512]] of two integer numbers [[20240910110120]].
It works like this. For two numbers $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ $a>b$ write the following chain

$a=b*q_0+r_0$
$b=r_0*q_1 + r_1$
$r_0=r_1*q_1+r_2$
$\vdots$
$r_{k-1}=r_k*q_{k+1}+0$

$r_k$ is the LCD here.
