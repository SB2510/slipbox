# What are the Landau symbols?
The lambda symbols are used to represent different properties about the relation of two sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ [[20241002211453]]. [[20241104084927]]
## big-O
$a_n = O(b_n)$ means, that there exists a constant C($\in \mathbb{C}$), so that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: |\frac{a_n}{b_n}| < C$.

## small-O
$a_n = o(b_n)$ means that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n}=0$ is true.

## Asymptotic equality $\sim$
$a_n \sim b_n$, means that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n}=1$ is true.
