# What is O(n) notation? 
O(n) notation is a way of denoting how an algorithms run-time relative to the input(time-complexity) grows, as the input grows larger.
With O(n) you can approximate worst and best-case runtime relative to the input in an algorithm has.
There is also space-complexity, which does the same as time, but with memory consumption.
