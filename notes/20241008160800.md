# How to subtract using the one's complement? 

In order to subtract a binary [[20241007151817]] number Y from a binary number X ($X-Y$) you first have to follow these steps: 
1. Calculate the one's complement $Y'$ of $Y$ [[20241008153136]]
2. Add $Y'$ to X
3. Now there are 2 possibilities
    1. If there is an extra bit remove the bit bit from the front and add it to the result
    2. If there is no extra bit find the one's complement of the result and add a negative sign
