# What is a polynomial?
A polynomial is an expression, that can be written in the following form: 
$a_0 + a_1 * x^{(1)} + a_2 * x^2 + … + a_{n-1} * x^{(n-1)} + a_n * x^n$ or
$\sum_{n=0} a_n*x^n$

Polynomials can be functions if written in the form of $f(x)=a_0 + a_1 * x^{(1)} + a_2 * x^2 + … + a_{n-1} * x^{(n-1)} + a_n * x^n$.
Polynomials have coefficients (in this case $a_0 - a_n$)
