# What are real numbers?
The real numbers are an extension of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ [[20240910110436]].
They contain not only all rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, but also all numbers which cannot be expressed as $\frac{m}{n} | m \in \Z, n \in \Z \setminus \{0\}$ (irrational numbers [[20240910111102]]).
They can be defined as the following: 
"The set of all positive and negative, ending and unending decimal expansions - where
numbers with the peroid $999...$ are identified with their ending decimal expansion -
is called the set $\R$ of the real numbers"

Real numbers are made up of a whole part x ($x \in \Z$) and a fraction part r ($0 < r < 1$).
