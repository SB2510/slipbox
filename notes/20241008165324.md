# Subtract 12 from 16 in binary using the two's complement?
$12_{10}$ is $1100_2$ and $16_{10}$ is $10000_2$ so we have to add  a leading zero to $12_{10}$.
Next find the two's complement[[20241008163228]] of $12_{10}$. $01100_2$ which inverted is $10011_2$. Add 1 and we get $10100_2$.
Now we add $10000_2$ and $10100_2$, which result in $100100_2$, which has an extra bit, which we cut off to get
$00100_2$, which is $4_{10}$ which is the correct result.
