# What is the Cauchy Criterium?
## Sequence
The Cauchy Criterium for sequences states, that a real sequence [[20241002211453]] is convergent iff it is a cauchy sequence [[20241021164431]].

## Series
The Cauchy Criterium for series' states, that a series is convergent if and only if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $N(\epsilon)$, so that $|\sum_{k=n}^m a_n| < \epsilon$ for all
$m ≥ n ≥ \epsilon$
