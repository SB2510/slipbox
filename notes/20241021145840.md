# What is the sandwhich theorem? 
The sandwhich theorem is a theorem regarding sequences [[20241002211453]]. It states, that if a sequence can be "sandwhiched" between two other
sequences, which are respectively larger and smaller than, or equal, to all elements of the series and both of the outer sequences's limits are the same, then the middle theorem has the same limit.
