# How to convert decimal numbers to binary fixed comma representation? 
To convert a decimal number to its binary [[20241007151817]] fixed comma representation [[20241010164142]] you have to 
First set the sign bit and then convert the part before and after the comma into their binary representation.
The integer part gets converted with $2^n$ for the corresponding numbers, while the fractional part is converted with $2^{-n}$.

# Example
Convert $420.625_{10}$ to its binary fixed comma representation.

Sign bit is 0 because it is positive.
$420_{10}$ is $110100100_2$
Now convert $0.625_{10}$ into its binary representation, which is $101_2$.

Result $0110100100.101_2$
