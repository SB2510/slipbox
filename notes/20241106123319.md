# How is the information content of a symbol calculated? 
The information content of a symbol is dependent on its frequency in the message. 
There is a measure called relative frequency for this calculated with the lenght $n$ of the message and the amount of times a certain symbol $x$ appears in
the message $n_x$:  $p=\frac{n_x}{x}$.

The information content of a symbol in a message is therefore $\frac{1}{p}$ (symbols that appear often have low information content).
