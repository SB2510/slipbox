# What are the guard, round and sticky bits (GRS)?
The guard, round and sticky bits are bits, that are appended to floating point numbers [[20241010165723]] in order to allow for maximum accuracy when applying operations. To be precise they have the function of ensuring, that an operation applied to rounded operands returns the same result as the rounded result of 
the operation with unrounded operands.
