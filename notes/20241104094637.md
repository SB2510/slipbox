# What is the binomial coefficient? 
The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ of two natural numbers [[20240910105916]] is a nicer representation for $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$([[20241104093649]]). It is the coefficient of the $x^k$ term of the binomial expansion of $(1-x)^n$.
It could be said, that it yields the n-th row of pascals triangle[[20241104095223]] (row=n element=k).
