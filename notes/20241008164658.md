# How to subtract using the two's complement of a binary number? 
To subtract using the two's complement [[20241008163228]] of a binary[[20241007151817]] number follow these steps: 
1. Make both numbers $X$ and $Y$ have the same amount of bits
2. Calculate the twos complement $Y'$ of $Y$
3. Add the $X$ and $Y'$
4. Now there are 2 possibilities again
    1. If there is an extra bit remove it and the remaining bits are the answer
    2. If there isn't an extra bit find the two's complement of the result and add a negative sign.
