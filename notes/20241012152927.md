# How to convert a number to its floating point representation? 
To convert a number $x$ to its floating point representation[[20241010165723]] (base x) do the following:
1. convert the number to the base of your desired representation
2. Normalize (shift so there is only one non-fractional place)
3. calculate the exponent (in excess notation in binary)
4. Set the sign bit and fill the remaining bits of the mantissa with zeroes

This would be what you would get in binary
| 1 bit | 8 bit                       | 23 bit                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Sign  | exponent in excess notation | Mantissa(remaining space filled with zeroes) |
