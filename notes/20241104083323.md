# What rules are there for arithmetics with series'?
There are two rules for arithmetics with convergent[[20241002213119]] series' 

## Addition of convergent series $\sum_{n>=0}a_n$ and $\sum_{n>=0} b_n$
Two convergent series can be added.
$\sum_{n>=0} (a_n + b_n) \iff \sum_{n>=0} a_n + \sum_n{n>=0} b_n$

## Multiplying with a scalar factor $\sum_{n>=0} \lambda a_n$
A series may be multiplied with a scalar factor $\lambda$.
$\sum_{n>=0} \lambda a_n \iff \lambda \sum_{n>=0} a_n$
