# What parameters are there for floating point number representations?
Floating point number representations $\mathbb{F}$ [[20241010165723]] have 5 parameters.
$\mathbb{F}(b,p,e_{min}, e_{max}, denorm)$.

* b stands for the base of the number
* p stands for the length of the mantissa
* $e_{min}$ stands for the minimal exponent
* $e_{max}$ stands for the maximal exponent
* denorm stands for "this number is denormalized"
