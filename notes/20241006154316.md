# How to convert a number from any source- to any destinationsystem?
In order to convert a number from any source- to any destinationsystem [[20241006153047]] you can apply one of the following algorithms:
Always make the multiplication table for the destination base
## When the new base is larger: 
Write the expanded form of you number. e.g. $11201_3= (((1*3+1)*3+2)*3+0)*3+1$
Then you go through all of the multiplications and additions and write them straight into you destination base

## When the new base is smaller:
Same as before, but be careful not to represent any multiplication or addition as something, that is not representable in the smaller base.
E.g. converting from base 9 to base 7 convert everything to base 7
