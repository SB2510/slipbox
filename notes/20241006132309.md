# How to prove cluster points of a sequence?

1. Find the points you want to prove as cluster points [[20241006132309]] (e.g. -1 and 1)
2. Find a way to rewrite the sequence [[20241002211453]] to only produce the cluster points (e.g. rewriting the series to only produce 1 and rewriting the sequence to only produce -1)
3. Prove, that the new sequence converges to the cluster point. (e.g. proving 1 or -1 as a cluster point).
