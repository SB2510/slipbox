# How to add with numbers in excess notation? 
To add with numbers in excess notation [[20241010151125]] with an excess e you convert both numbers $x$ and $y$ into their excess forms by adding the 
excess to both numbers resulting in $x_e$ and $y_e$. Then you add them up and subtract the excess (since if you didn't the new number would have $2e$).

## Example
With a number $A=12$ and a number $B=-10$ and an excess $e=16$ you would have to add e to both numbers resulting in 
$A_e=28$ and $B_e = 6$. Convert those numbers and the excess into binary
$(A_e)_2 = 11100$ and $(B_e)_2 = 00110$ and the excess $e_2 = 10000$.
Now add your to numbers up. Resulting in $100010_2$ and subtract $10000_2$.
Now you have $10010_2$, which is $18_{10}$ in excess notation and $2_{10}$ as a normal decimal number (18-16 = 2).
