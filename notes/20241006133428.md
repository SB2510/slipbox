# Find and prove all cluster points of $a_n=(-1)^n+\frac{1}{n}$
[[20241006132309]]
1. Step one: find all cluster points
We see, that $(-1)^n$ produces either 1 or -1 and $\frac{1}{n}$ converges to 0, so likely the series has the cluster points 1 and -1 (so it is divergent, because there is no single point of convergence)
2.  Step two: Reform the series to only produce one of the cluster  points
    1.  Producing 1: To only produce 1 we can reform the sequence to: $a_n=(-1)^{2*n}+\frac{1}{n}$
    2.  Producing -1: To only produce -1 we can reform the sequence to: $a_n=(-1)^{2n+1}+\frac{1}{n}$

3. Proving 1 and -1 as the convergence points of their respective sequences
    1. Proving 1 as a limit of $a_n=(-1)^{2*n}+\frac{1}{n}$
