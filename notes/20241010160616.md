# What is the fundamental theorem of algebra?
The fundamental theorem of algebra states, that for a polynomial [[20240920124236]] with n complex number [[20240910112146]] coefficients $a_0,a_1...,a_n$ 
$p(z)=a_n*z^n+a_{n-1}*z^{n-1}...+a_0$ there exist n complex numbers $z_1,...,z_n$, that are zeroes of the 
polynomial $p(z)$ (they solve $p(z)=0$).

$p(z)=a_n*z^n+a_{n-1}*z^{n-1}+...+a_0=a_n*(z-z_1)*(z-z_2)...(z-z_n)$
These zeroes are unique except for their order, which can be rearranged because of commutativity.
