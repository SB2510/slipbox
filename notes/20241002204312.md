# What is a decimal expansion/representation? 
A decimal expansion/representation of a number is its expression as a sequence of symbols consisting of decimal digits.

It consists of two sums 
$\sum_{i=0}^{k}b_i*10^{i}+ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{a}{10^i}$
The first part is called the integer [[20240910110120]] part of the number, while the latter part is called the fractional part.
