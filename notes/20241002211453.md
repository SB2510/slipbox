# What is a sequence? 
A sequence is an arrangement $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3,...$ of numbers ($(a_n)_{n>=0}$).
A sequence may also be understood as a function [[20240920132211]] [[20240926140025]] $a: \N \to X$.
The numbers $a_n$, that make up a sequence are called its elements. $n$ is called the index of the element $a_n$.
