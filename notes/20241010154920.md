# How to complete the square? 
To complete the square[[20241010154644]] of a degree 2 polynomial [[20240920124236]] $a*x^2 + bx + c=0$
1. Move $c$ to the other side of the equation $a*x^2 + bx=-c$.
2. If $a$ is not 1 divide both sides by $a$ $x^2+\frac{b}{a}x=\frac{-c}{a}$
3. Add the square of half the coefficient of the x-term, $\frac{b}{2a}^2$ to both sides of the equation $x^2+\frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b}{2a}^2=\frac{-c}{a} + \frac{b}{2a}^2$
4. Factor the left side of the equation $\frac{2ax+b}{2a}^2=-\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b}{2a}^2$
5. Apply the square root to both sides $\frac{2ax+b}{2a}=\sqrt{-\frac{c}{a}+\frac{b}{2a}^2}$
