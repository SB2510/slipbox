# What problems are permutations of a set? 
Permutations of a set[[20240929155814]] are an ordering problem [[20241104095747]] where you want to
find out how many unique possible orders there are for n elements.

e.g. How many possible arrangements are there of the letters a,b,c? 

These problems are always solved using $n!$

The solution to the above problem is $3!=6$.
