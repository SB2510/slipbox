# What problems are ordering without restrictions? 
Ordering without restrictions refers to ordering problems [[20241104095747]], that fit the description of producing different orders of sets without any restrictions. "Variation with repetition".

e.g. How many different combinations can a lock with 10 places and 9 digits per places have?

The answer to these kinds of problems is always $A^k$, where $A$ is the set of elements to pick from and $k$ is the length of the tuples you produce.
