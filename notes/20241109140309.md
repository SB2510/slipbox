# What problems are selection of a submultiset? 
Selection of a submultiset is a special case of the selection of a set[[20241109135221]] selection problem [[20241104095747]].
It is when $k$ elements of a set $A$ are selected and an element can appear multiple times. "Combinations with Repetition".

e.g. How many different 7-element subsets does the set $\{a,b,c\}(n=3)$ have? 

These problems are solved using
$\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!}=\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.

The solution to the above problem is $\frac{(3+7-1)!}{7!2!}=36$.
