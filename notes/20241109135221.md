# What problems are selection of a subset?
Selections of a subset are selection problems[[20241104095747]] in which you pick $k$ elements of a set [[20240929155814]] 
$A$. "Combination without repetition". So you want to find out how many $k$-element subsets of $A$ there are. 

e.g. You have a friend group of 60 people. How many groups of 3 can you go out with?

These problems are always solved using the binomial coefficient [[20241104094637]]
$\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

The solution for the above problem would be 
$\frac{60!}{3!57!}=34220$
