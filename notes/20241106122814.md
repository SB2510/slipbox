# How are the arcus functions defined? 
The arcus functions are defined as the inverse functions of the sine, cosine and tangent functions in a certain interval.

## Arc-Sine
Arcsine is defined as the inverse of the sine function in the interval of $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.

## Arc-Cosine
Arccosine is defined as the inverse of the cosine function in the interval of $[0, \pi]$.

## Arc-Tanget 
Arctangent is defined as the inverse of the tangent functions in the interval of $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.
