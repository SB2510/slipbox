# Why are floating point numbers normalized? 
In order to avoid two floating point representation [[20241010165723]] $m*b^e$ being ambiguous.
For this purpose the mantissa [[20241010165917]] is limited to one digit in front of the comma (meaning no 0)
and b and e being an integer number [[20240910110120]] $b>1$
