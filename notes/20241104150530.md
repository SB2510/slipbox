# What is partial fraction decomposition? 
Partial fraction decomposition is a technique used, when there is a polynomial[[20240920124236]] in the denominator of a fraction and you want to split the
fraction into multiple fractions. 

e.g. $\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}$ and you want to represent it as 3 fractions then you can write
$\frac{a}{n+1} + \frac{b}{n+2} + \frac{c}{n+3} = \frac{2}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}$. Multiply both sides by the denominator and then solve the resulting equation system (or use the here clearly visible)
zeroes (-1, -2 and -3) of the polynomial.
