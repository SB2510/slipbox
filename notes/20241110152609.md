# What theorems are there for continuous functions? 
- Bolzanos zero theorem [[20241110152043]]
- Intermediate value theorem [[20241110152336]]
- If I is a closed interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ and $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function [[20241110150919]], then $f(I)$ is also a closed Interval.
