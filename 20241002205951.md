# What is a subset of a set? 
A subset of a set [[20240929155814]] B of a set A is a set with the following definition.
$B=\{x|x\in A\}$
So a subset is a set, where all elements are also elements of A.

$B \subset A$ denotes, that B is a subset of a.

Every subset is a subset of itself. $A \subset A$

$A \subset B \land B \subset A \implies A=B$
