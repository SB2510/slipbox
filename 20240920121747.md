# What is a Universe of Discourse
A universe of discourse is a mathematical term referring to the confines in which a problem is looked at.

## Example
The universe of discourse (UoD) could be important when talking about subtraction.
For example looking at the term $f(x) = x-b$. Here the universe of discourse makes a big difference for the possible 
values of x and b. If the universe of discourse is confined to the natural numbers $\N$ then the difference of x and b may not be smaller than 0.
If we're talking about the Integers then this doesn't apply.
