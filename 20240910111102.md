# What are irrational numbers?
Irrational numbers are a subset of real numbers $\R$ [[20240910111450]].  
They can be defined as $\R \setminus \mathbb{Q}$.
They contain all numbers, which cannot be expressed as rational numbers [[20240910110436]] $\frac{m}{n}$.
An example of this would be $x^2 = 2$ (or $\sqrt{2}$)
